# Assignment 2 – LINQ Operations in C#

## Problem Statement
Write a C# program that takes a list of integers from the user and performs the following operations using LINQ:
- Find all numbers greater than 50
- Sort the numbers in ascending order
- Find the square of each number

---

## Description
This console application demonstrates the use of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to perform filtering, sorting, and transformation operations on a list of integers provided by the user.

The program accepts space-separated integers as input, processes them using LINQ queries, and displays the results in a clear and structured format.

---

## Features
- User input handling for integer lists
- LINQ `Where` for filtering values
- LINQ `OrderBy` for sorting
- LINQ `Select` for data transformation
- Clean and readable console output

---

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Framework
- LINQ
- Console Application
- Visual Studio

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio
3. Run the project
4. Enter integers separated by spaces
5. View filtered, sorted, and squared results

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding LINQ fundamentals
- Applying functional programming concepts in C#
- Processing collections efficiently
- Writing clean and maintainable code
